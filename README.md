# Speer Project
For the backend assessment, I utilized ASP.NET
API and conducted testing using Postman. To run my code, 
navigate to the Speer project directory, 
then to the code folder, followed by local 
and GitHubCLI. Open the project with Visual Studio. 
The testing environment requires Visual Studio and Postman.
